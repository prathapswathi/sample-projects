&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCTION TO BASIC CONCEPTS OF DATABASE SYSTEMS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is Data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The raw facts are called as data. The word &amp;ldquo;raw&amp;rdquo; indicates that they have not been processed.&lt;br /&gt;
Ex: For example 89 is the data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is information?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The processed data is known as information.&lt;br /&gt;
Ex: Marks: 89; then it becomes information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is Knowledge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Knowledge refers to the practical use of information.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Knowledge necessarily involves a personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DATA/INFORMATION PROCESSING:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The process of converting the data (raw facts) into meaningful information is called as&lt;br /&gt;
data/information processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FILE ORIENTED APPROACH:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The earliest business computer systems were used to process business records and&lt;br /&gt;
produce information. They were generally faster and more accurate than equivalent manual&lt;br /&gt;
systems. These systems stored groups of records in separate files, and so they were called file&lt;br /&gt;
processing systems.&lt;br /&gt;
1. File system is a collection of data. Any management with the file system, user has to&lt;br /&gt;
write the procedures&lt;br /&gt;
2.File system gives the details of the data representation and Storage of data.&lt;br /&gt;
3.In File system storing and retrieving of data cannot be done efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Concurrent access to the data in the file system has many problems like a Reading the&lt;br /&gt;
file while other deleting some information, updating some information&lt;br /&gt;
5.File system doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide crash recovery mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;
Eg. While we are entering some data into the file if System crashes then content of the&lt;br /&gt;
file is lost.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Protecting a file under file system is very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
The typical file-oriented system is supported by a conventional operating system.&lt;br /&gt;
Permanent records are stored in various files and a number of different application programs&lt;br /&gt;
are written to extract records from and add records to the appropriate files.&lt;/p&gt;
