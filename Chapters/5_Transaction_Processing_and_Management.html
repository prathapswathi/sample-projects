Transaction processing means dividing information processing up into individual, indivisible operations, called transactions, that complete or fail as a whole; a transaction can&amp;rsquo;t remain in an intermediate, incomplete, state (so other processes can&amp;rsquo;t access the transaction&amp;rsquo;s data until either the transaction has completed or it has been &amp;ldquo;rolled back&amp;rdquo; after failure). Transaction processing is designed to maintain database integrity (the consistency of related data items) in a known, consistent state.

A transaction, a typical example of which would be a customer order, consists of a series of events (accepting the order, allocating stock and so forth) that are treated as a whole. While theoretically transaction processing is a subset of event processing the integrity considerations described above mean that it is treated as a separate function.

Transaction processing databases are databases that have been designed specifically to optimise the performance of transaction processing, which is often referred to as OLTP (online transaction processing).
