&amp;nbsp;Database Security

Database security covers and enforces security on all aspects and&amp;nbsp;components&amp;nbsp;of databases. This includes:


	Data stored in database
	Database server
	Database management system (DBMS)
	Other database workflow applications


Database security&amp;nbsp;is generally planned, implemented and maintained by a database administrator and or other information security professional.

&amp;nbsp;

Some of the ways database security is analyzed and implemented include:


	Restricting unauthorized access and use by implementing strong and multifactor access and data management controls
	
	Load/stress testing and capacity testing of a database to ensure it does not crash in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack or user overload
	
	Physical security of the database server and backup equipment from theft and natural disasters
	
	Reviewing existing system for any known or unknown vulnerabilities and defining and implementing a road map/plan to mitigate them
