Redundant Relationships

Sometimes in your model you will get a &amp;#39;redundant relationship&amp;#39;. These are relationships that are already indicated by other relationships, although not directly.

In the case of our example there is a direct relationships between customers and products. But there are also relationships from customers to sales and from sales to products, so indirectly there already is a relationship between customers and products through sales. The relationship &amp;#39;Customers &amp;lt;----&amp;gt; Products&amp;#39; is made twice, and one of them is therefore redundant. In this case, products are only purchased through a sale, so the relationships &amp;#39;Customers &amp;lt;----&amp;gt; Products&amp;#39; can be deleted. The model will then look like this:
